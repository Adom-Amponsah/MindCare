# Firebase Initialization Fix

## Problem
The application was not properly initializing Firebase and saving user data to Firestore during signup and signin. This was causing:

1. Missing user documents in Firestore
2. 400 Bad Request errors when trying to access subcollections
3. Chat functionality failing because user data wasn't properly saved

## Solution

### 1. Created FirebaseInit Component
- Added a dedicated component to handle Firebase initialization
- Tests Firestore connectivity on startup
- Automatically creates user documents if they don't exist
- Shows proper loading and error states

### 2. Updated App Structure
- Wrapped the entire application in the FirebaseInit component
- Ensures Firebase is properly initialized before rendering the app
- Added explicit import of Firebase config in main.jsx

### 3. Fixed Collection Structure
- Changed collection names to match Firebase console conventions
- Ensured parent documents exist before creating subcollections
- Added proper document ID generation

### 4. Added Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for Firebase operations
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Added retry functionality for connection issues

## How It Works Now

1. When the app starts, it:
   - Imports Firebase config
   - Tests connection to Firestore
   - Checks if current user exists in Firestore

2. During signup/signin:
   - User authentication happens through Firebase Auth
   - User document is created in Firestore if it doesn't exist
   - All required subcollections are initialized
   - Session is recorded

3. For chat functionality:
   - Checks if user document exists before accessing chat history
   - Creates user document if needed
   - Uses proper collection names and document IDs

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Clear your browser cache/local storage
2. Sign up with a new account
3. Check Firebase console - you should see:
   - A user document in the 'users' collection
   - A welcome message in the 'chat_history' subcollection
   - A session record in the 'sessions' subcollection
